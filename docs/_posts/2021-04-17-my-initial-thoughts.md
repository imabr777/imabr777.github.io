I honestly haven't tried that many webdev technologies, but honestly Jekyll is turning out to be quite a smooth experience. The ease of Markdown combined with how Jekyll auto-generates most things is veryy convenient. Of course, there are limitations, primarily to do with the fact that this is mostly a static site generator, but as far as static sites go, this is a lot easier than having to code everything from scratch. Some modifications are necessary, of course, but other than that, it's good. I still have to go through themes and customization and stuff, but it looks good so far.

Well done, Jekyll.
